Key Project Undertaken
======
* **Instance Segmentation:**  
*Guide:[Prof.Amit Sethi](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~asethi/)*
    * Implemented deep neural network **Mask-RCNN** to detect and provide segmentation masks to object belonging to 300 different categories
    * Extended the model Mask-RCNN to Open Image dataset provided by Google AI fo Instance Segmentation Open Image Challenge 2019

* **Image Classification on CIFAR:**  
*Guide:[Prof.Amit Sethi](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~asethi/)*
    * Implemented forward and backward pass of different layers of Fully Connected Neural Networks from scratch with the flexibility to take variable size input
    * Trained the implemented Neural Network for object classification on CIFAR dataset and achieved 75-80% accuracy on each class of CIFAR

* **License Plate Detection and Recognition:**  
*Guide:[Prof.Arjun Jain](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=elmWdycAAAAJ&hl=en)*
    * Implemented an EECV 2018 paper in PyTorch using CNN layers to extract features from the input image
    * Used fully connected layers in the end for prediction of the bounding box around License Plate
    * Built a **Recognition** Module which exploits **Region of Interest** from CNN layers to extract features map of interest and several **classifiers** to predict the corresponding license plate number

* **Automation of Gate Security System:**  
    * Collected around 1700+ images of vehicles and manually annotated all the desired class present in it
    * Trained model **YOLOv3** on annotated images to detect vehicle along with its type and locate the License Plate of the detected vehicle for recognition purpose
    * Delivered a **Detection Module** of Automation model for automating the gate security system to ease the guard’s job

* **Non-Invasive Glucometer:**  
*Guide:[Prof.Shalabh Gupta](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/shalabh)*
    * Designed an analog circuit to get the amplified voltage level for corresponding glucose concentration present in the body
    * Collected blood sugar concentration data using the designed setup and invasive glucometer and trained Regression model on it
    * Delivered an alternative **low-cost** solution to traditional invasive glucose testing method for **monitoring glucose-related** diseases

* **Image Classifier:**  
*Guide:Udacity*
    * Built an **Image classifier** using **Neural Network** in PyTorch to recognize 102 different species of flowers present in the dataset
    * Achieved a test accuracy of 95% by setting appropriate **optimizer**, **loss function** and **learning rate**
