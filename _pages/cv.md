Key Project Undertaken
======
* **Instance Segmentation:**
*Guide:[Prof.Amit Sethi](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~asethi/)*
    * Implemented deep neural network **Mask-RCNN** to detect and provide segmentation masks to object belonging to 300 different categories
    * Extended the model Mask-RCNN to Open Image dataset provided by Google AI fo Instance Segmentation Open Image Challenge 2019

* **Image Classification on CIFAR:**
*Guide:[Prof.Amit Sethi](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~asethi/)*
    * Implemented forward and backward pass of different layers of Fully Connected Neural Networks from scratch with the flexibility to take variable size input
    * Trained the implemented Neural Network for object classification on CIFAR dataset and achieved 75-80% accuracy on each class of CIFAR

* **License Plate Detection and Recognition:**
*Guide:[Prof.Arjun Jain](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=elmWdycAAAAJ&hl=en)*
    * Implemented an EECV 2018 paper in PyTorch using CNN layers to extract features from the input image
    * Used fully connected layers in the end for prediction of the bounding box around License Plate
    * Built a **Recognition** Module which exploits **Region of Interest** from CNN layers to extract features map of interest and several **classifiers** to predict the corresponding license plate number

* **License Plate Detection and Recognition:**
